# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

To endorse an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and admins pledge to make our project
a harassment-free place for everyone--regardless of age, race, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, religion, or education.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Being mindful of others' opinions
* Being respectful to each and everyone
* Accepting decisions made by others in projects and/or code fragments
* Being able to have a clear communication amongst peers AND yourself
* Most importantly, HAVE FUN!

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Bullying
* Harassment
* Spreading malicious rumours or gossip, or insulting someone.
* Stealing code that is not yours 

## Our Responsibilities

We as admins and/or contributors are responsible for setting the table for 
unaccpetable behavior and language. We have the right to remove, edit, or reject 
code, issues, or other problems that don't obey this code of conduct.
Please be mindful and show empathy towards others working to expand this code;
anyone who is seen to disregard these rules will be deemed as offensive, harmful, or threatening.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. You are free to 
endorse a code that you may believe is beneficial to this project into a social media account
or simply email the offical account for this project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at shrestakalla07@gmail.com or shreyakalla02@gmail.com. We take 
these issues VERY seriously, and this will be investigated thoroughly. We are 100% obligated to keep all issues
private, and will not expose any names. A response for any of these issues will be given within a few days. 

Project contributors/admins who also do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct will face
temporary or PERMANENT repercussions. This will be determined by other project contributors/admins.
